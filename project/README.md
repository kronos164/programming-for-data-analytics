#### About me:

My name is Cain√£ Oliveira. I hold a Master's degree in Psychology from the [University of Porto](https://www.up.pt/portal/en/) and am currently advancing my education in data analytics through a postgraduate course at the [Atlantic Technological University: ATU](https://www.atu.ie/). Simultaneously, I am pursuing a Master's in Artificial Intelligence at the [International University of Applied Sciences](https://www.iu.org/). My academic journey reflects a strong commitment to integrating the insights of human behaviour with the cutting-edge technologies of AI and data science, aiming to harness these disciplines in innovative and impactful ways.
